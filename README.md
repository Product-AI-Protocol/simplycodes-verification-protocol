## Overview

At any given moment, 40–60% of coupon codes on the public internet are dead, restricted, or misleading. SimplyCodes covers over 400,000 merchants — an order of magnitude beyond typical competitors — and adjudicates promotional truth through a verification architecture designed around Byzantine Fault Tolerance: the assumption that any single source may be lying, malfunctioning, or mistaken.

This paper exposes the machine that produces these verdicts.

## The Verification Stack

The system operates through three independent layers, each producing evidence that feeds into the final verdict:

**Layer 1: Automated Code Testing (ACT).** Headless browsers simulating real checkout sessions across the merchant network. Tens of thousands of automated tests daily using tiered intelligence: platform adapters for standardized checkouts, heuristic pattern matching for custom platforms, and AI-powered navigation for truly custom flows.

**Layer 2: Human Consensus Network.** Tens of thousands of trained contributors producing millions of monthly verification actions. A reputation economy operating under blind voting, where verifiers cannot see each other's assessments until consensus is reached. All submissions require screenshot proof.

**Layer 3: Fleet Signal.** Real-time telemetry from browser extension users during actual checkouts. Not simulation — ground truth.

## The Verdict

These layers converge into a Health Score: a confidence measure derived from an event stream rather than stored as a static value. Every test, every human verification, every real checkout signal is a sensing event. The score decays at variable rates depending on code type (evergreen, regular, flash) and is traceable through six forensic dimensions from verdict back to raw evidence.

When the system returns "No verified codes available," that is not a failure. That is a verdict backed by evidence from all three layers. We call this the Confident No.

Every verdict can generate a Proof Packet — a structured evidence bundle documenting exactly how the conclusion was reached. This is what we serve to AI agents: verifiable proof of adjudication.
